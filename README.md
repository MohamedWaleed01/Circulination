# Circulination
Art with lines and circles only

Understanding CircuLination:
Starting the project I've decided to divide the canvas to 5 parts:

• First part top left which is "Waves". Waves represent periodic motion present in everyday's routine such as Radio waves, Sound waves, and Ocean tides. As an artist, I saw the harmony of nature in every ripple, represented in the most basic forms.

• Second part top right which is "Magnetic Field". Invisible forces swirl, pulling and pushing in perfect lines in an (unseen dance of energy). The magnetic field whispers its silent power, altering the environment in patterns we can't feel. Yet chaos finds order in its quiet embrace, directing every movement of nature.

• Third part middle left which is "Planets". Like beads on a string, the planets revolve in harmony, bound together by unseen lines of gravity. While the universe dances in silence, circles are turned into routes creating infinite loops.

• Fourth part bottom left which is "Atoms". While atoms may appear far away, but they're touchable in our daily lives. Every object we see, every breath we take, is composed of these unseen yet present building blocks, spinning and arranging themselves in the form of tiny circles, shaping everything around us.

• Fifth part which is "Flowers". Flowers expand with stems drawn as flowing lines, and their blossoms form beautiful circles that are similar to indications of geometry in nature. Together, they represent simplicity and beauty, combining art and life.

Last but not least, two different connecting patterns are the intersecting lines forming networks. On the other hand, harmonizing patterns include the concentric circles radiating balance and the parallel lines flowing in rhythmic order. Together, these patterns create this amazing project!
